# React App
This code runs on the frontend of the website, and provides the user with all of the features.<br>
It was written using [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JS framework for Single-Page Web Apps.<br>
[MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) was used to provide the components, which are based off Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) principles.
